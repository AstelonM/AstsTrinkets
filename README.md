# Asts Trinkets
AstsTrinkets is a Paper plugin in which I add all sorts of trinkets. 

The trinkets are just regular Minecraft items that have a special function added by the plugin. The trinkets range from 
mostly amusing stuff, to items you probably wouldn't want those you don't trust to get.

It was made for 1.16.5, but it _should_ work fine all the way to 1.18.2 as well.

## Usage
Currently, the plugin has only two commands, `/trinkets give <trinket> (optional player name)` and 
`/trinkets clear (optional player name)`. Both require the permission `aststrinkets.admin`.

The only way to obtain a trinket is using the give command. Some trinkets require an additional permission, 
`aststrinkets.op`. These are trinkets that are either unbalanced and could allow players to mess things up in the server,
or trinkets that are experimental and might not work as they should.
