# Ast's Trinkets
AstsTrinkets is a Paper plugin in which I add all sorts of trinkets. 

The trinkets are just regular Minecraft items that have a special function added by the plugin. The trinkets range from 
mostly amusing stuff, to items you probably wouldn't want those you don't trust to get.

The plugin requires Minecraft version 1.18. Expect errors or the plugin not working at all when using earlier versions.

## Usage
Currently, the plugin has only three commands, `/trinkets give <trinket> (optional player name) (optional amount)` and 
`/trinkets clear (optional player name)` require the permission `aststrinkets.admin` to use. `/trinkets help` can be used
by anyone, it only requires the player to hold a trinket.

The only way to obtain a trinket is using the give command. Some trinkets require an additional permission, 
`aststrinkets.op`. These are trinkets that are either unbalanced and could allow players to mess things up in the server,
or trinkets that are experimental and might not work as they should.
